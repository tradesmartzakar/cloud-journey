## 🗓️ Week 1 Reflection – Foundations & First Wins

**Focus:** Establishing visibility, building fundamentals, and shipping real AWS projects.

**Wins:**
- Set up my public proof system (GitHub profile + Cloud Journey repository)
- Deployed my first EC2-based Apache web server
- Troubleshot and resolved S3 public access issues
- Successfully hosted a static portfolio website using Amazon S3
- Documented each project with READMEs, screenshots, and repositories

**Lessons Learned:**
- Visibility matters — if it’s not documented, it didn’t happen
- AWS is secure-by-default, and understanding access control is critical
- Small configuration details (file names, object paths, policies) can break or fix deployments
- Clear documentation reinforces learning and makes progress measurable

**Challenges:**
- Debugging S3 `403 AccessDenied` errors
- Aligning bucket policies with object paths and static website configuration
- Understanding the difference between S3 object URLs and website endpoints

**What I’d Improve Next Time:**
- Plan file naming and folder structure earlier
- Capture screenshots during each step instead of at the end
- Add short architecture notes to each project
