## cloud-journey
Aspiring Cloud / Security Engineer documenting real-world AWS builds, failures, and lessons learned in public.
My hands-on cloud build log, projects, and reflections
## Cloud Journey (Public Proof Log)
## Why I'm Here
I’m transitioning into cloud to build a durable career, solve real problems, and create
options for my family.
## My Focus (next 90 days)
- AWS foundations (IAM, S3, EC2, CloudWatch)
- IaC with Terraform
- Documenting every build (README, screenshots, LinkedIn)
- ## How to Use This Repository
Each folder represents a real cloud project or lab.
Projects are documented end-to-end so others can follow along or replicate the build.
Structure:
- `/projects` – Hands-on AWS & Terraform builds
- `/notes` – Short reflections and learning summaries
- `/screenshots` – Proof of work
  ## Week 1 – Identity & First Wins
- Set up GitHub + LinkedIn for cloud visibility
- Wrote this public proof log
- Next up: S3 + IAM “Public Access Problem” lab
-
